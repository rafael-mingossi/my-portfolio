    "paragraph1": "Originally from Brazil, where I built a solid career in Finance and Tax for almost 10 years, I realised my true passion lay elsewhere. So my wife and I decided to shake things up – we moved to Australia and have called it home since 2016. Here I found my calling, graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology with a major in Web and Mobile Development, which provided the foundation to officially start my career as a developer.",
    "paragraph2": "Now, I bring a global perspective to my work with over 4 years in the JavaScript ecosystem. I've built my career transforming designs into seamless digital experiences that users love to interact with. My experience extends beyond the front end, working with AWS, GraphQL APIs, and both Shopify and CMS integrations.",
    "paragraph3": "In my free time, I'm exploring Java to deepen my understanding of OOP paradigms – a journey I'm finding fascinating – and to enhance my back-end development skills. I maintain a continuous learning approach with TypeScript, CSS, and testing frameworks. I approach each project with both technical precision and creative problem-solving, believing that the best interfaces are those users don't even notice they're using."
