        With over 4 years in the JavaScript ecosystem, I've built my career
        transforming designs into seamless digital experiences that users love
        to interact with. At Atelier, I've spent the last 3+ years developing
        responsive, component-based applications using NextJS and SASS, while
        collaborating closely with design teams to ensure pixel-perfect
        implementation. My experience extends beyond the front end, working with
        AWS, GraphQL APIs, and CMS integrations. My time as a freelancer with
        Foxxy Labs sharpened my skills in component architecture and state
        management optimization, while my React Native work for Kiss 'n Tell APP
        taught me the value of rapid bug resolution and clear documentation.
        Originally from Brazil and now calling Australia home for 9 years, I
        bring a global perspective to my work. My Bachelor's Degree in
        Information Technology with a major in Web and Mobile Development
        provided the foundation, but my continuous self-learning in TypeScript,
        Tailwind, and testing frameworks keeps me at the cutting edge. I
        approach each project with both technical precision and creative
        problem-solving, believing that the best interfaces are those users
        don't even notice they're using.
